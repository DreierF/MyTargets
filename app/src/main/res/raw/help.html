            <h1>Get started with MyTargets</h1>
            <p>MyTargets allows you to record all results of you archery training rendering pen and paper obsolete. MyTargets is divided into three main categories: Trainings, bows and arrows. Trainings contains all the information you have collected during your training sessions. The bows section is the place to document your equipment properties and settings e.g. your sight marks. And the arrows section contains information about different arrow types.</p>
           
            <section> 
                <h2>Organize trainings</h2>
                <p>A training is organized into one or multiple rounds. Each round may contain an arbitrary number of ends, whereby an end contains up to predifined number of shot arrows.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Create a training</summary>
                    <p>To create a new training tap the orange circle at the bottom of the trainings page. Now you can select out of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Free Training</strong>: Allows you to freely set distance, target face type and diameter as well as the number of arrows you want to shot per end.</li>
                        <li><strong>Training with standard round</strong>: Allows you to select from a huge number of common standard rounds. You can also define your own if none of the predefined ones fits your needs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Select a target face</summary>
                    <p>You can select from a variety of target faces (3). Some target faces do have different <strong>scoring styles</strong> (1). The scoring style describes the score assocated with a particular area of the target face. Additionally the diameter of the target face can be specified (2). </p>

                    <p><strong>Note: </strong>The diameter of a spot target face is relative to the target face of the full target. For example a WA 5 Ring Spot with 80cm diameter in the app represents a spot in that has actually only 40cm in real-life, because the full WA target face would have 80cm.</p>

                        <li><strong>Recurve style (10-1)</strong>: Same as previous, but the inner two golden rings are shown as one ring, rewarded with 10 points (no X).</li>
                        <li><strong>Compound style</strong>: Only the innermost golden ring scores 10 points. The outermost two golden rings are shown as one.</li>
                        <li><strong>11, 10, 9, ..., 1</strong>: The innermost ring scores 11. The score decreases with every ring by 1.</li>

                    <p>Besides documenting the arrows used in a particular training, you may also annotate individual shots with the number of the arrow. You can enable the behaviour on a per-training basis. When you create the training you have to set the option accordinly:</p>
