            <h1>Get started with MyTargets</h1>
            <p>MyTargets allows you to record all results of you archery training rendering pen and paper obsolete. MyTargets is divided into three main categories: Trainings, bows and arrows. Trainings contains all the information you have collected during your training sessions. The bows section is the place to document your equipment properties and settings e.g. your sight marks. And the arrows section contains information about different arrow types.</p>
           
            <section> 
                <h2>Organize trainings</h2>
                <p>A training is organized into one or multiple rounds. Each round may contain an arbitrary number of ends, whereby an end contains up to predifined number of shot arrows.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Create a training</summary>
                    <p>To create a new training tap the orange circle at the bottom of the trainings page. Now you can select out of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Free Training</strong>: Allows you to freely set distance, target face type and diameter as well as the number of arrows you want to shot per end.</li>
                        <li><strong>Training with Standard Round</strong>: Allows you to select from a huge number of common standard rounds. You can also define your own if none of the predefined ones fits your needs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Select a target face</summary>
                    <p>You can select from a variety of target faces (3). Some target faces do have different <strong>scoring styles</strong> (1). The scoring style describes the score assocated with a particular area of the target face. Additionally the diameter of the target face can be specified (2). </p>
                    <img src="images/target_face_selection.png" />
                    <p><strong>Note: </strong>The diameter of a spot target face is relative to the target face of the full target. For example a WA 5 Ring Spot with 80cm diameter in the app represents a spot in that has actually only 40cm in real-life, because the full WA target face would have 80cm.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>WA scoring styles</summary>
                    <p>In the following all WA scoring styles are described in more detail:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recurve style (X-1)</strong>: The innermost golden ring scores 10 points, but is marked as X. The outer golden rings score 10 and 9 accordingly. The score decreases with every ring by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recurve style (10-1)</strong>: Same as previous, but the inner two golden rings are shown as one ring, rewarded with 10 points (no X).</li>
                        <li><strong>Compound style</strong>: Only the innermost golden ring scores 10 points. The outermost two golden rings are shown as one and score 9 points.</li>
                        <li><strong>11, 10, 9, ..., 1</strong>: The innermost ring scores 11. The score decreases with every ring by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>X, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1</strong>: Gold scores 5, red 4, blue 3, black 2 and white 1 points. The innermost golden ring is recorded as X.</li>
                        <li><strong>9, 7, 5, 3, 1</strong>: Gold scores 9, red 7, blue 5, black 3 and white 1 points.</li>
                        <li><strong>FCFS Color (Reversed 10-1)</strong>: Play scoring style where white scores 10, black 8, blue 6, red 4, outer gold 2 and the inner two gold 1. Typically shot with 6 arrows per end. Only one arrow is counted per color. The maximum achievable score is 31 points per end, when every arrow is shot into a distinct color.</li>

                    <summary>Arrow numbering</summary>
                    <p>Besides documenting the arrows used in a particular training, you may also annotate individual shots with the number of the arrow. You can enable the behaviour on a per-training basis. When you create the training you have to set the option accordinly:</p>

                    <summary>What is a Standard Round?</summary>
                    <p>A standard round is a predefined training template, which specified the exact number of rounds, ends and arrows shot per end. Additionally the distances and target faces are fixed.</p>
                    <p>The app provides you with a variety of standard rounds that are commonly used. </p>

                <h2>Statistics</h2>
                <p>The statistics allow you to get an aggregated view on your training data.</p>

                    <summary>Statistics elements</summary>
                    <p>In the following the main UI components are described:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Line chart</strong>: Shows the average score per arrow per end. The orange linear regression line shows the overall trend. The chart can be zoomed by pinching two fingers horizontally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Distribution chart</strong>: Shows the distribution of arrows amonst the available rings. If no segment is selected, the overall coutn of hits and misses is shown. By tapping on a segment the exact number of shots in this category is shown.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dispersion pattern</strong>: Shows all shots on a single target face including the selected grouping method (can be chnaged in the app's settings). If you tap on the dispersion pattern you get a bigger version of the dispersion pattern. From the details screen you can also share the dispersion pattern image or print it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Arrow ranking</strong>: If you have used the arrow numbering feature in one of the selected trainings, the arrow rankings are shown below. The arrows with the best grouping are placed at the top of the list. Tapping on an arrow number takes you to a dispersion pattern, which only shows the shots of the selected arrow.</li>
